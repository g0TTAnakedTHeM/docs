# Getting Started

## 1. Invite the Bot
To start using Azalea Gate, you must first invite it to your Discord server.
-   **[Click here to Invite](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1432727411698700378&permissions=275683508224&scope=bot%20applications.commands)**
-   Ensure you grant the bot **Administrator** permissions for full functionality (Role assignment requires managing roles).

## 2. Initial Setup
Once the bot is in your server, run the setup command to initialize basic settings.

```
/setup
```

This command will:
-   Create a "Verified" role (if one doesn't exist).
-   Set up the basic permissions structure.
-   Prompt you to configure your first verification rule.

## 3. Accessing the Dashboard
Manage your server's complex settings, subscriptions, and billing via the web dashboard.

1.  Go to **[Dashboard](https://azaleagate.com/dashboard)**.
2.  Login with **Discord**.
3.  Select your server from the list.

> **Note**: You must have `Manage Server` permissions to view a server in the dashboard.
