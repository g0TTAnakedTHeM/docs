## How to Upgrade

### 1. Purchase a License

2.  Click **"Buy New License"**.
3.  Select your plan (Medium or Pro) and checkout via Paddle.

### 2. Assign License to Server
Once purchased, the license appears in your **License Inventory**.
1.  Go to **[Dashboard > Billing](https://azaleagate.com/dashboard/billing)**.
2.  Find your "Unassigned" license in the list.
3.  Use the dropdown to select the server you want to upgrade.
4.  Click **Assign**.

### 3. Moving Licenses
You can revoke a license from a server and move it to another one at any time via the Dashboard.
