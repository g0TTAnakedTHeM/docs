# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why can't verify my wallet?
Ensure you have allowed **Direct Messages from Server Members** in your Discord Privacy Settings. The bot sends verification links via DM for security.

### Does Azalea Gate support Bitcoin?
No, we currently support EVM (Ethereum, Polygon, Base, etc.), Solana, and TON.

### How do I update my role after selling an NFT?
The bot automatically scans for changes, but it may take some time. You can force an update by running:
```
/verify
```
again, or waiting for the periodic background check (Verification frequency depends on your server's plan).

### I purchased a plan but my server is still "Free"?
Purchasing a license puts it in your **Inventory**. You must manually assign it to the server.
1.  Go to **[Dashboard > Billing](https://azaleagate.com/dashboard/billing)**.
2.  Find the unassigned license.
3.  Select your server and click **Assign**.
